              4. Advanced Legal Drafting Technology
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Talk To My Lawyer employs proprietary intelligent systems
              purpose-built for legal letter generation. We believe in full
              transparency about how these technologies work and how your data
              interacts with them.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">
              4.1 Proprietary Legal Models
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Our platform is powered by proprietary large language models that
              are specifically trained and fine-tuned for legal letter drafting.
              Unlike general-purpose tools, our models are trained on legal
              precedents, local court rules, jurisdiction-specific procedures,
              formatting conventions, and the structural requirements of formal
              legal correspondence. These models do not simply generate letter
              content — they produce complete, properly formatted legal letters
              that adhere to jurisdiction-specific citation styles, procedural
              conventions, and court-specific quirks.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">
              4.2 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
              We employ a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture that
              grounds every letter in real, verifiable legal research and case
              law. When drafting your letter, our system retrieves relevant
              statutes, regulations, and legal precedents specific to your
              jurisdiction and legal matter before generating content. This
              ensures that legal citations and references are grounded in actual
              legal authority rather than synthesized from training data alone.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">
              4.3 Feedback-Driven Improvement
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Our models continuously improve through a feedback pipeline driven
              by attorney review outcomes. When licensed attorneys review, edit,
              and approve letters on our platform, those review patterns are
              used to improve quality over time. This feedback loop ensures our
              system learns from real attorney expertise, producing increasingly
              accurate and effective legal letters. Quality scores, edit
              distances, and approval rates are tracked and analyzed to measure
              and drive improvement.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">
              4.4 How Your Data Interacts With Our Systems
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
              When you submit a letter request, the case details you provide
              (such as the description of your legal matter, parties involved,
              jurisdiction, and desired outcome) are processed by our automated
              systems to generate your draft letter. We want you to understand
              the following:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-muted-foreground ml-4">

                details) is not used to train models serving other users
              </li>
              <li>
                Case details are processed in isolated pipelines to generate
                your specific letter
              </li>
              <li>
                Aggregated, de-identified patterns from attorney reviews may be
                used to improve overall system quality
              </li>
              <li>
                All automated output is reviewed by a licensed attorney before
                it is delivered to you
