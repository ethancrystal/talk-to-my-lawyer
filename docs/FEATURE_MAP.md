## 1. Platform Overview

Talk-to-My-Lawyer is an AI-powered legal letter platform with mandatory attorney review. It features a four-stage AI pipeline (OpenAI Research → Claude Drafting → Claude Assembly → Claude Sonnet Vetting). The platform enforces a strict paywall: after draft generation, the user waits 24 hours for a "Draft Ready" email. Upon clicking the link in the email, subscribers view an uncopyable, watermarked draft inside a modal and must subscribe or pay $200 for attorney review before jumping into the attorney queue.

## 3. Architecture Evolution (Phase 108+)

The platform underwent a major technical debt remediation to decompose monolithic files into maintainable directory modules.

### 3.1 Frontend Directory Modules

Each major feature is now a directory with a thin `index.tsx` orchestrator, a `hooks/` subfolder, and focused sub-components.

- **DocumentAnalyzer/**: `useDocumentAnalyzer`, `FileUploadZone`, `AnalysisResults`.
- **ReviewModal/**: `useReviewModal`, `ReviewSidePanel`, `ReviewActionDialogs`.
- **Learning/**: `useLessonsTab`, `QualityTab`, `LessonsTab`.
- **Affiliate/**: `useAffiliateAdmin`, `AffiliatePerformanceTab`, `AffiliateCodesTab`.
- **AffiliateDashboard/**: `useAffiliateDashboard`, `AffiliateStatsCards`, `AffiliateEarningsSection`.
- **ReviewDetail/**: `useReviewDetail`, orchestrates existing panels.
- **SubscriberLetterPreviewModal/**: New modal for `client_approval_pending` status.

### 3.2 Backend Decomposition

- **server/stripe/**: Split into `client`, `checkouts`, `subscriptions`, `coupons`.
- **server/learning/**: Split into `extraction`, `quality`, `categories`, `dedup`.
- **server/emailPreview/**: Split into `builder`, `templates`.
- **server/routers/**: tRPC routers organized into sub-directories (e.g., `routers/review/`, `routers/affiliate/`).

## 4. Subscriber Approval Workflow (Phase 109+)

A new **Subscriber Letter Preview Modal** was added to the `client_approval_pending` status.

| Feature               | Implementation                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read-Only Preview** | Full-screen modal showing the `final_approved` version content.           |
| **Approve & Send**    | Subscriber approves the letter and provides recipient email for delivery. |
| **Request Changes**   | Subscriber can request revisions (limited to 5 per letter).               |
| **Revision Paywall**  | Re-triggers Stripe checkout if the free revision count is exceeded.       |
| **Auto-Open**         | Modal auto-opens when a letter transitions to `client_approval_pending`.  |

## 5. Letter Pipeline & Resilience

### 5.1 Pipeline Stages

1. **Research** (OpenAI `gpt-4o-search-preview` with web search)
2. **Drafting** (Claude `claude-opus-4-5`)
3. **Assembly** (Claude `claude-opus-4-5`)
4. **Vetting** (Claude `claude-sonnet`)

### 5.2 Stale Lock Recovery (Phase 108+)

- **New Cron**: `server/stalePipelineLockRecovery.ts` runs every 15 minutes.
- **Function**: Automatically detects and resets letters stuck in `researching` or `drafting` for >30 minutes.
- **Recovery**: Releases the lock, resets status to `submitted`, and re-enqueues for a fresh run.

## 6. Code Quality & Logging

- **Pino Logger**: Replaced all 427 `console.log/warn/error` calls with structured `logger` calls.
- **TS Compliance**: Fixed all 176 `TS2769` pino overload errors. The project now has **0 TypeScript errors**.
- **Migrations**: Inline startup migrations (raw SQL) moved to `drizzle/0044_startup_migrations_extraction.sql`.
- **TODO Resolution**: All 4 remaining `TODO/FIXME` comments in the active codebase have been resolved.

## 7. Historical Changelog (Summary)

- **Phase 108:** Frontend God Component Extraction, Backend Monolith Decomposition, Pino Logging Hardening, Stale Lock Recovery Cron.
- **Phase 109:** Subscriber Letter Preview Modal for `client_approval_pending` status.
