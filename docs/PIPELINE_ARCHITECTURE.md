## Orchestration & Side-Effect Optimizations

The pipeline orchestrator (`server/pipeline/orchestrator.ts`) and modular stage handlers (`server/pipeline/orchestration/`, `server/pipeline/research/`, `server/pipeline/vetting/`) are optimized for high throughput:

- **Parallel DB Writes:** Independent database writes (e.g., updating workflow job status, updating letter status, and logging review actions) are executed in parallel using `Promise.allSettled()` instead of sequentially.
- **Batched Notifications:** Admin and attorney notifications are fanned out in parallel.
- **Reduced DB Reads:** Database records are passed through function parameters to eliminate redundant queries in hot paths.
- **Shared Citation Revalidation:** Citation verification logic is centralized and reused across the orchestrator to keep the code DRY.

## Active Pipeline Path

**Primary path: DIRECT 4-stage API calls. n8n is dormant (fallback/alternative, not active).**

## RAG + Recursive Learning (Self-Improving Loop)

This system uses **attorney-approved letters** to improve draft quality from the **very first iteration** of new letters. The loop is fully automated and non-blocking — failures log but never block approval.

### What we use RAG for

- **Draft quality uplift:** Provide style/structure examples in **Stage 2 drafting** so the first draft is closer to previously approved outcomes.
- **Training data capture:** Build supervised datasets for fine-tuning, enabling longer-term model improvement.

### Exactly how it works (step-by-step)

1. **On attorney approval (post-approval hooks):**
   - **Embedding capture:** The final approved content is embedded using OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dims) and stored in `letter_versions.embedding` (pgvector).
   - **Provider rationale:** OpenAI embeddings are used for stable, cost-efficient similarity search. Fine-tuning is handled by Vertex AI because tuning jobs target Gemini base models (`gemini-1.5-flash-002`).
   - **Training capture:** A single JSONL example is generated with:
     - `system`: generic drafting instruction
     - `user`: intake summary (letter type, subject, jurisdiction, issue, desired outcome, parties)
     - `assistant`: approved letter content  
       This file is uploaded to `gs://<GCS_TRAINING_BUCKET>/training-data/YYYY/MM/DD/letter-<id>-<ts>.jsonl` and logged in `training_log`.

2. **During Stage 2 drafting (first draft):**
   - The intake summary is embedded and used to query `match_letters()` in Postgres.
   - **Top 3 similar approved letters** (similarity ≥ **0.70**) are returned and injected into the **system prompt** as reference examples (each trimmed to **2,000 characters of raw letter content only**, excluding any prompt headings/metadata).
   - The prompt explicitly instructs the model to **adapt style/structure — not copy verbatim**.
   - If retrieval fails or no matches exist yet, the pipeline continues without RAG (no blocking).

3. **Recursive learning / fine-tuning loop:**
   - **Trigger condition:** When **50 or more examples** exist since the last run.
   - **Tracking mechanism:** The count is based on `training_log` rows after the most recent non-failed `fine_tune_runs.started_at`.
   - **Dataset merge:** All per-example JSONL files are merged into a single dataset (`fine-tune-datasets/YYYY-MM-DD-merged.jsonl`).
   - A **Vertex AI tuning job** is submitted (base model: `gemini-1.5-flash-002`) and recorded in `fine_tune_runs`.
   - This creates a continuous improvement cycle where every approved letter strengthens the next generation of drafts.

**Required configuration:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GCP_PROJECT_ID`, `GCP_REGION`, `GCS_TRAINING_BUCKET`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.

## Service Resilience — Primary vs Fallback

This section documents every service pair in the system: what is primary, what the fallback is, what triggers the switch, and what capability is lost on fallback.

| Service               | Primary                                                      | Fallback                                                                       | Trigger                                                                                                | Capability Lost on Fallback                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Letter generation** | Local 4-stage pipeline (OpenAI Research → Opus × 2 → Sonnet) | n8n external workflow                                                          | `N8N_PRIMARY=true` env var set (currently NOT set — dormant)                                           | n8n path is less tested; not recommended for production                                             |
| **Stage 1 Research**  | OpenAI `gpt-4o-search-preview` (web search)                  | Perplexity `sonar-pro` → OpenAI stored prompt → Groq → synthetic               | OpenAI research call fails                                                                             | Degrades through failover chain; final synthetic fallback sets `researchUnverified` flag            |
| **Rate limiting**     | Upstash Redis (`@upstash/ratelimit`)                         | Fail-open / allow-all (general endpoints); fail-closed / deny (auth endpoints) | Redis credentials missing (`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` / `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`) or Redis unreachable | General endpoints lose abuse protection; auth endpoints remain protected via fail-closed behaviour  |
| **Monitoring**        | Sentry (frontend + backend DSN)                              | `console.error` / `console.warn`                                               | Sentry DSN not configured or Sentry SDK init fails                                                     | Errors still surface in server logs but are not aggregated, alerted, or tracked in Sentry dashboard |
| **Background jobs**   | pg-boss (PostgreSQL-native queue)                            | None — enqueue failure throws `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` and refunds user usage   | Database unavailable when enqueueing                                                                   | Letter submission fails; usage is automatically refunded; no silent degradation                     |

### Notes

- **Letter generation routing:** `N8N_PRIMARY` must equal the string `"true"` AND `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` must be set and start with `https://`. All three conditions must be true simultaneously to activate n8n. The current production environment does not set `N8N_PRIMARY`, so the local pipeline is always used.
- **Stage 1 research failover:** If all providers fail, the letter's `researchUnverified` column is set to `true` and `webGrounded` is `false`. This is surfaced to attorneys in the review UI.
- **Rate limiter fail-open vs fail-closed:** Auth endpoints (login, signup, forgot-password) use fail-closed (deny) when Redis is down, to prevent unbounded brute-force. All other endpoints use fail-open (allow) to avoid blocking normal usage during Redis outages. See `server/rateLimiter.ts` lines 133–170.
- **pg-boss / background jobs:** There is no inline fallback for queue failures. If the database is unavailable and a job cannot be enqueued, the submission is rejected with a user-facing error and any consumed usage credit is refunded. pg-boss uses the existing Supabase PostgreSQL connection — no separate Redis dependency.

## Routing Decision (pipeline.ts ~line 2716)

```ts
const useN8nPrimary =
  process.env.N8N_PRIMARY === "true" &&
  !!n8nWebhookUrl &&
  n8nWebhookUrl.startsWith("https://");
```

**Three conditions must ALL be true to activate n8n (alternative path):**

| Condition                  | Current Value  | Result                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| `N8N_PRIMARY=true`         | **NOT SET**    | ❌ Short-circuits here |
| `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` set      | Set in secrets | ✅                     |
| URL starts with `https://` | Yes            | ✅                     |

Because `N8N_PRIMARY` is not set, the pipeline **always** uses the direct 4-stage path (primary).

## Model Summary

| Stage    | Role    | Primary Provider | Primary Model           | Fallback Provider             | Fallback Model | Timeout |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| Research | Stage 1 | OpenAI           | `gpt-4o-search-preview` | Perplexity / Groq / synthetic | failover chain | 90s     |
| Draft    | Stage 2 | Anthropic        | `claude-opus-4-5`       | —                             | —              | 120s    |
| Assembly | Stage 3 | Anthropic        | `claude-opus-4-5`       | —                             | —              | 120s    |
| Vetting  | Stage 4 | Anthropic        | `claude-sonnet`         | —                             | —              | 120s    |

**Stage 1 failover chain:** OpenAI gpt-4o-search-preview (primary, web-grounded) → Perplexity sonar-pro (if `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` set) → OpenAI stored prompt → Groq Llama 3.3 70B → synthetic fallback. Research is web-grounded on the primary path; synthetic fallback sets `researchUnverified`.

## n8n Status

- `n8nCallback.ts` is registered as an Express route at `/api/pipeline/n8n-callback`
- n8n is a **dormant alternative path** — it is not auto-selected under normal conditions
- It is only activated when `N8N_PRIMARY=true` is explicitly set (plus `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` starting with `https://`)
- If `N8N_PRIMARY=true` is set and the n8n webhook call itself fails, the pipeline errors out (there is no automatic fallback from n8n back to the local 4-stage pipeline at that point)
- n8n path exists as an optional override for debugging/experimentation only
- **Do NOT set `N8N_PRIMARY=true` in production** without fully testing the n8n workflow
