/**
 * Cloudflare Worker — static frontend + API proxy.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   - Static assets (dist/public) served directly from Cloudflare edge
 *   - /api/* requests proxied to Railway backend (Express + pg-boss pipeline)
 *
 * The real Node.js server with tRPC, Supabase, pg-boss, and the AI pipeline
 * still runs on Railway. This Worker exists solely to (1) serve the client
 * from Cloudflare's global edge for low-latency asset delivery, and (2)
 * transparently proxy API calls so the client can use relative /api/trpc
 * paths without CORS or domain-switching complexity.
 *
 * The `run_worker_first: ["/api/*"]` rule in the Cloudflare config ensures that
 * non-API routes are served directly from the assets bucket without
 * invoking this Worker at all — cheap, fast, and edge-cached globally.
