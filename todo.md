## Architecture Notes (Permanent Reference)

- [x] **Pipeline routing confirmed (Feb 25, 2026):** Direct 3-stage API calls are ACTIVE. n8n is DORMANT.
  - Stage 1: Perplexity sonar-pro (research, 90s timeout)
  - Stage 2: Anthropic claude-opus-4-5 (draft, 120s timeout)
  - Stage 3: Anthropic claude-opus-4-5 (final assembly, 120s timeout)
  - n8n only activates if BOTH N8N_PRIMARY=true AND N8N_WEBHOOK_URL are set in env
  - N8N_PRIMARY is NOT set → n8n is completely dormant
  - Full details: docs/PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md
