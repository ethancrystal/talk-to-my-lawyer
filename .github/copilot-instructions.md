# Talk to My Lawyer

## Overview
Talk to My Lawyer is a full-stack legal letter platform that provides AI-drafted, attorney-reviewed legal letters for common disputes, specifically within California jurisdiction. The platform aims to improve accessibility and efficiency in legal correspondence through email-based delivery and simplified pricing. Key capabilities include a multi-stage AI pipeline for drafting and vetting, a recursive learning system, and a document analyzer, all supported by human attorney oversight. The project's vision is to streamline legal assistance and make it more widely available.

## User Preferences
I prefer iterative development, with a focus on delivering small, functional pieces of the project regularly.
I value clear and concise communication. Please avoid overly technical jargon where simpler explanations suffice.
When proposing changes or new features, please provide a brief overview of the impact and reasoning.
I prefer to be asked before major architectural changes or significant refactoring efforts are undertaken.
All UI/UX decisions should prioritize a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly experience.
Ensure that the [client/public/logo-full.png](client/public/logo-full.png) file is always the latest brand asset.
The system should prioritize California-specific legal requirements and user experience.
The delivery method for legal letters should strictly be "Email Only."
The legal letter generation process should be a clear, multi-step flow for the user.
Pricing plans should be simple and easy for users to understand, with attorney review explicitly included.
All mentions of the "employee" role in the UI should be presented as "Affiliate."
The onboarding experience for new subscribers should be guided and informative.
PDF downloads of approved letters should maintain professional formatting and clear indicators of attorney approval.
The review process for attorneys should be efficient and provide all necessary information for approval.
Interactive elements, like the "How It Works" section, should be engaging with scroll-paced animations while respecting user accessibility preferences (`prefers-reduced-motion`).
The anti-hallucination pipeline should be robust, with clear flagging for unverified research and enforced attorney acknowledgment.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui components, wouter for routing.
- **Branding**: Consistent use of [client/public/logo-full.png](client/public/logo-full.png).
- **Homepage**: Features a "View Your First Letter For Free" badge and "Get Started" CTA, with a first-visit popup.
- **Role Terminology**: "Employee" displayed as "Affiliate".
- **Onboarding**: Multi-step modal for new subscribers.
- **PDF Download**: Professional PDF generation with rich text, attorney-approved badge, and certified footer.
- **How It Works**: Scroll-paced animations with SVG gradients, respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Shared Footer**: 4-column layout ([client/src/components/shared/Footer.tsx](client/src/components/shared/Footer.tsx)) with brand info, services, company links, newsletter signup, and social media.
- **Competitive Positioning**: Homepage hero, pricing page, and homepage pricing section all use the unified positioning: "AI drafting + attorney review, delivered in hours, starting at \$299."
- **Trust Section**: Homepage "By the Numbers" section with 4 stat-driven trust badges.
- **Competitive FAQ**: FAQ page has a "Why Talk to My Lawyer" category with 5 competitive comparison entries.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, wouter.
- **Frontend Module Boundaries**: `client/src/pages/subscriber/Dashboard.tsx` and `client/src/pages/subscriber/LetterDetail.tsx` are composition shells; feature logic and UI live in `client/src/components/subscriber/dashboard/` and `client/src/components/subscriber/letter-detail/`.
- **Backend**: Express.js + tRPC (type-safe API), Node.js 20.
- **Admin Router Module Boundaries**: Admin tRPC is composed in `server/routers/admin/index.ts` from domain modules (`letters.ts`, `users.ts`, `jobs.ts`, `learning.ts`) under `server/routers/admin/`.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Replit's built-in database (migrated from Supabase), accessed with Drizzle ORM + `postgres-js`. All 24 schema tables are applied via the migrations in [drizzle/migrations/](drizzle/migrations/) and `drizzle/*.sql`.
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (cookie-first, Google OAuth PKCE with SameSite=None), custom Resend verification emails. Admin 2FA enforced.
- **AI Pipeline**: 4-stage pipeline: (1) OpenAI `gpt-4o-search-preview` Research with web search (Perplexity `sonar-pro` optional failover), (2) OpenAI GPT-4o Drafting (Claude Sonnet fallback), (3) Claude Sonnet Assembly (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini fallback), (4) Claude Sonnet Vetting (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini fallback). Two-tier failover per stage. Groq OSS last-resort for research.
- **Pipeline Module Boundaries**: Main routing entrypoint remains `server/pipeline/orchestrator.ts`; shared orchestration logic is split into `server/pipeline/orchestration/`, and stage logic is split into `server/pipeline/research/` and `server/pipeline/vetting/`.
- **n8n MCP Integration**: When `N8N_PRIMARY=true`, the pipeline routes through the user's n8n cloud instance (`designtec.app.n8n.cloud`) via MCP (Model Context Protocol) as the primary path. Falls back to legacy webhook, then to the in-app 4-stage pipeline if n8n is unavailable. MCP client module: [server/n8nMcp.ts](server/n8nMcp.ts). Direct connection using `N8N_MCP_URL` + `N8N_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` env vars. Tool selection: explicit via `N8N_MCP_TOOL_NAME` env var, or single-tool auto-select, or keyword match (`legal-letter`, `letter-submission`, `legal-pipeline`, `ttml`). The n8n callback endpoint (`/api/pipeline/n8n-callback`) remains functional for async workflow results.
- **Recursive Learning System**: Self-optimizing knowledge engine that captures structured lessons from attorney feedback, including AI-powered categorization, deduplication, and effectiveness tracking.
- **RAG Embedding + Training Pipeline**: Generates OpenAI embeddings for approved letters, captures training examples, injects similar approved letters as few-shot RAG context, and auto-triggers Vertex AI fine-tuning. Vector similarity search uses **pgvector** (built into Supabase PostgreSQL) as the active vector store. Vertex AI Vector Search is an optional upgrade path for very large vector volumes (millions of vectors); pgvector handles current scale well and avoids the ~\$70–110/month cost of Vertex AI Vector Search.
- **Pipeline Worker**: Uses pg-boss (PostgreSQL-native) for job queues, eliminating the Redis dependency for processing.
- **Rate Limiting**: Fine-grained, per-user limits using Upstash Redis (fail-open for general usage).
- **Database Security Hardening**: RLS enabled on all tables, `search_path = ''` on public helper functions.
- **Database Architecture**: Uses a primary + read replica topology with transparent fallback.
- **Health Check & Monitoring**: Public `/health` and admin `/health/details` endpoints check database, Redis (rate limiting only), Stripe, Resend, Anthropic, OpenAI, Cloudflare R2.
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry.
- **Deployment**: Railway (previously); now also runs on Replit.

### Replit Environment Configuration
- **Primary workflow**: `Start application` — runs `npm run dev` on port 5000 (webview)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (via `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL` direct connection string). SSL is applied conditionally — enabled for Supabase/cloud URLs, skipped for local connections.
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth (JWT tokens) — requires `SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
- **Required secrets** (set in Replit Secrets): `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`.
- **Pipeline AI secrets** (required for pipeline): `OPENAI_API_KEY` (primary research + drafting), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (assembly/vetting + draft fallback). Optional: `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` (research failover).
- **n8n MCP secrets** (for n8n pipeline): `N8N_MCP_URL`, `N8N_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN`. Env vars: `N8N_PRIMARY=true` (shared), optional `N8N_MCP_TOOL_NAME` (explicit tool binding).
- **Optional secrets**: `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_DSN`, `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`.
- **Port**: 5000 (configured via `PORT` env var in shared environment).

### Feature Specifications
- **Demand Letter Template Library**: Database-driven template gallery (`letter_templates` table) with seed scenarios and admin CRUD panel.
- **Dynamic Intake Forms**: `LETTER_TYPE_CONFIG` in [shared/types.ts](shared/types.ts) defines `situationFields` per letter type, rendering dynamically. Users can create custom intake templates.
- **Multi-step Letter Generation Form**: Guides users through letter type, jurisdiction, parties, incident details, desired outcome, and exhibit uploads. Address fields use Google Places Autocomplete for real-time suggestions.
- **Google Places Autocomplete**: `AddressAutocomplete` component ([client/src/components/shared/AddressAutocomplete.tsx](client/src/components/shared/AddressAutocomplete.tsx)) provides address auto-suggestions on sender and recipient address fields. Requires `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` secret. Restricted to US addresses. Gracefully degrades to plain text input if API key is missing or API fails.
- **Pricing Plans**: Three tiers (Single Letter, Monthly, Yearly), all including attorney review.
- **Role-Specific IDs**: Sequential human-readable IDs (SUB-XXXX, EMP-XXXX, ATT-XXXX).
- **Affiliate Program**: Single-use rotating discount codes with commission settlement.
- **Anti-Hallucination Pipeline**: Employs deterministic validation, token-level grounding, citation registry, word count enforcement, and jurisdiction consistency checks, flagging unverified research.
- **Counter-Argument Anticipation**: Stage 2 drafting generates 3–5 likely opposing arguments with strength ratings; Stage 4 vetting validates coverage. Displayed in a dedicated "Counter" tab in attorney review.
- **Evidence Intelligence**: Document Analyzer extracts structured evidence items with confidence levels. Evidence is displayed in analysis results and carried through to the letter submission form via `AnalysisPrefill`.

## External Dependencies
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database, authentication services.
- **Drizzle ORM**: Object-relational mapping.
- **postgres-js**: PostgreSQL client.
- **Resend**: Transactional email sending.
- **Stripe**: Payment processing.
- **OpenAI API**: Primary research (gpt-4o-search-preview with web search), drafting, embeddings, document analysis.

## Testing

### Unit/Integration Tests (Vitest)
- Config: [vitest.config.ts](vitest.config.ts)
- Scope: `server/**/*.test.ts`, `server/**/*.spec.ts`
- Run: `npm test` or `vitest run`

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
- Config: [playwright.config.ts](playwright.config.ts)
- Test directory: [e2e/](e2e/)
- Run: `npm run test:e2e` or `npx playwright test`
- 5 suites: auth, intake form, subscriber dashboard, attorney review, admin dashboard
- Uses system Chromium (auto-detected from NixOS)
- Requires test user accounts (env vars `E2E_SUBSCRIBER_EMAIL`, etc.)
- CI: runs as separate `e2e` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Does NOT interfere with vitest — completely separate test directories and configs

### Enum Drift Prevention
- Canonical reference: [docs/LIFECYCLE_AND_ENUMS.md](docs/LIFECYCLE_AND_ENUMS.md)
- Source of truth for enum values: [drizzle/schema/constants.ts](drizzle/schema/constants.ts)
- Drift-detection tests: [server/__tests__/statusMachine.test.ts](server/__tests__/statusMachine.test.ts) — verifies TS consts match pgEnums, `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` keys match `LETTER_STATUSES`, `STATUS_CONFIG` covers all statuses, and `letterStages.ts` stage mappings cover all statuses
- Legacy pgEnum-only values (`generated_unlocked`, `upsell_dismissed`) are marked with inline comments in [drizzle/schema/constants.ts](drizzle/schema/constants.ts)
