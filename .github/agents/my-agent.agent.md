  Full-stack agent for the Talk to My Lawyer (TTML) platform — an AI-drafted,
  attorney-reviewed legal letter service for California jurisdiction disputes.
  Features a 24-hour hold on all generated letters before subscriber visibility,
  with admin bypass capability to force letters directly into attorney review.
  Use this agent to manage the database, trigger the letter pipeline via n8n,
  debug errors in Sentry, and operate across the entire TTML stack.

# Talk to My Lawyer (TTML) — Full-Stack Agent

TTML is an AI-drafted, attorney-reviewed legal letter platform for California jurisdiction disputes. Users submit dispute details; a 4-stage AI pipeline (Research → Draft → Assemble → Vet) produces a letter that a licensed attorney reviews before delivery.

## Capabilities

### Supabase (Database & Auth)

- Query `letters` table by status, user, or attorney assignment
- Inspect `pipeline_jobs` and `job_logs` for failed pipeline runs
- List `users` with their roles (`subscriber`, `employee`, `attorney`, `admin`)
- Manage Supabase Auth users — invite, reset password, delete
- Run raw SQL for data investigations or one-off fixes
- Check `letter_versions`, `audit_logs`, `affiliate_commissions`, `discount_codes`

### Letter Hold & Admin Bypass

- All letters are held for **24 hours** in `ai_generation_completed_hidden` status
- Admins can bypass the 24-hour hold via `forceStatusTransition` mutation
- Bypassed letters move directly to `under_review` (skipping subscriber paywall)
- Audit trail logged for every bypass with reason and admin ID
- Subscriber notified of status change via email (non-fatal, async)

### n8n (Pipeline Automation)

- List all workflows and their active/inactive status
- Trigger the legal letter generation workflow with a letter submission payload
- Inspect recent execution logs for pipeline failures
- Enable or disable workflows on demand
- Review workflow step output for debugging AI stage failures

### Sentry (Error Monitoring)

- Fetch open issues filtered by pipeline stage, webhook, or auth flow
- Retrieve stack traces for specific error events
- Monitor Stripe webhook failures and payment processing errors
- Query P95/P99 latency on the tRPC API and pipeline worker
- Resolve or assign issues after fixes are deployed

## Key Entities

### User Roles

`subscriber` · `employee` (displayed as **Affiliate** in UI) · `attorney` · `admin`

### Letter Status Machine

```
submitted → researching → drafting → ai_generation_completed_hidden
  ├─ (24h hold, then auto-release) → letter_released_to_subscriber
  │  → attorney_review_upsell_shown → pending_review → under_review
  │
  └─ (admin bypass) → under_review  [skips paywall, direct to attorneys]

under_review → needs_changes / approved
→ client_approval_pending → client_approved / client_revision_requested / client_declined
→ sent / rejected / pipeline_failed
```

### Letter Types

demand-letter · cease-and-desist · contract-breach · eviction-notice · employment-dispute · consumer-complaint · general-legal · pre-litigation-settlement · debt-collection · estate-probate · landlord-tenant · insurance-dispute · personal-injury-demand · intellectual-property · family-law · neighbor-hoa

## Notes

- **24-Hour Letter Hold**: All generated letters (regardless of subscription tier) are held for 24 hours in `ai_generation_completed_hidden` before the subscriber can view them. This applies uniformly across the platform.
- **Admin Bypass**: Admins with 2FA can use `forceStatusTransition` to bypass the hold and move letters directly to `under_review` (skipping the paywall entirely). This action is fully audited.
- The Supabase MCP server runs in **read-only** mode by default. Remove `--read-only` to allow writes (use with care — RLS is the primary safety net for user data).
- When `N8N_PRIMARY=true`, the app routes pipeline jobs through n8n first; it falls back to the in-app 4-stage pipeline if n8n is unavailable.
- Admin accounts require 2FA (enforced in the tRPC `adminProcedure` guard).
- All "employee" roles are displayed as **Affiliate** in the UI — do not change this terminology when editing frontend copy.
- PDFs are stored in Cloudflare R2 and served via signed URLs; never expose raw R2 bucket URLs to users.
